# Providing Feedback — A Practical Guide

## 🎯 Feedback Is a Tool, Not a Goal

Feedback exists to **realize a change**. If your intention begins and ends with "I need to give feedback," you're not providing feedback — you're **dumping** it.

Before you open your mouth, answer one question: **What change do I want to see?**

If you can't articulate the desired outcome clearly, stop. You're not ready to give feedback yet.

## 🔧 Feedback Is Not the Only Tool

Feedback is one tool in a toolbox. Sometimes it's the wrong one.

| Tool | When to Use |
|---|---|
| **Lead by example** | When the behavior you want is best demonstrated, not explained |
| **Pair/shadow work** | When the gap is skill-based, not awareness-based |
| **Retrospectives** | When the issue is systemic or team-wide, not individual |
| **Process change** | When the environment causes the behavior, not the person |
| **Direct feedback** | When the person is unaware, and awareness alone can drive change |

Ask yourself: **Is feedback the most effective tool here, or just the most convenient one?**

## ✅ Positive Feedback Is Still Feedback

If you only give feedback when something's wrong, people learn to flinch when you say "can we talk?"

Positive feedback is not cheerleading. It's **reinforcement** — it tells people what to keep doing and why it matters. Without it, good behaviors fade because no one noticed.

**Bad positive feedback:**
> "Great job on the launch!" ← Vague. What specifically was great? They can't repeat what they can't identify.

**Good positive feedback:**
> "The way you structured the rollout in phases meant we caught the config issue in stage 1 before it hit production. That saved us hours."

Same rules apply: be **specific**, tie it to **impact**, and make it **timely**.

| | Corrective Feedback | Positive Feedback |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Change a behavior | Reinforce a behavior |
| **Risk of skipping** | Problem persists | Good behavior fades quietly |
| **Common mistake** | Too vague ("do better") | Too vague ("great job") |

> 💡 If your team only hears from you when something's broken, your feedback culture is broken too.

## ⚠️ The Always-Negative Pattern

If every piece of feedback you give is corrective, something is off — and it's probably not the receiver.

**What it signals:**
- You've trained yourself to only notice problems
- You may be using feedback as a control mechanism, not a growth tool
- The receiver stops listening — everything from you is a complaint, so nothing stands out

**What it does to the receiver:**
- Learned helplessness: "Nothing I do is good enough"
- Avoidance: They stop bringing you work, stop asking for input, stop being visible
- Trust erosion: Your feedback loses credibility — even valid points get dismissed because "that's just how they are"

**Check yourself honestly:**
- When was the last time you gave unprompted positive feedback to this person?
- Do you hold different people to different standards without realizing it?
- Are you giving feedback because you want improvement, or because noticing flaws makes you feel sharp?

If someone on your team dreads every interaction with you, your feedback isn't developing them — it's draining them. And a drained person doesn't grow.

> 💡 Consistent negative-only feedback says more about the giver than the receiver.

## 🤝 How Well Do You Know the Receiver?

This matters more than most people think.

- **High trust, strong relationship** → You can be direct. Context is already shared. The receiver will assume good intent.
- **Low trust, weak relationship** → Your feedback will likely be received as judgment, no matter how well you phrase it. Invest in the relationship first, or find someone with more trust capital to deliver it.
- **New relationship** → Tread carefully. You're still building the mental model of each other. Early feedback sets the tone — make it count.

> 💡 The same words land completely differently depending on who says them.

## ⏰ Timing: Is This the Right Moment?

Not all feedback is urgent. Classify before you deliver:

| Criticality | Examples | When to Act |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 **Blocking / harmful now** | Breaking production practices, toxic behavior toward a teammate, security violations | Immediately. Don't wait. Pull the person aside. |
| 🟡 **Important but not urgent** | Code quality patterns, communication gaps, meeting behavior | Next 1:1 or scheduled feedback session |
| 🟢 **Growth opportunity** | Presentation skills, strategic thinking, broader impact | Retro, career conversation, or development plan |

Forcing 🟢-level feedback into a 🔴-level delivery creates unnecessary stress and resistance.

## 🧠 The Asymmetry Problem

We are significantly more capable and comfortable **giving** feedback than **receiving** it.

This is not a character flaw — it's human wiring. When giving feedback, you're in control. When receiving it, your brain processes it as a potential threat.

**Implication for you as the giver:** The effort you put into crafting your feedback is probably 20% of what matters. The other 80% is how the receiver's brain processes it. Your job is to make that processing as safe as possible — not by sugar-coating, but by being clear on intent, specific on observations, and genuinely invested in the outcome.

## 🚫 The Preaching Trap

There is a razor-thin line between providing feedback and preaching.

**Feedback** sounds like:
> "In yesterday's review, I noticed X. The impact was Y. I think Z would work better because..."

**Preaching** sounds like:
> "You should really start doing X. That's just how it's done. Everyone knows that..."

The difference:

| | Feedback | Preaching |
|---|---|---|
| **Direction** | Dialogue | Monologue |
| **Anchor** | Specific observation | General opinion |
| **Intent** | Change a behavior | Prove a point |
| **Receiver's role** | Participant | Audience |

If the other person can't push back or ask questions, you're preaching.

## 🗺️ Context and Intent: Say the Why First

Feedback without context is a command. Commands trigger resistance, not change.

Before you describe the behavior, **share your intent and the context that led you here**. The receiver needs to see the same picture you see — otherwise they're defending against a surprise attack.

**Without context:**
> "You need to stop going straight to implementation without a design doc."

**With context and intent:**
> "I want our team to ship fewer rollbacks — that's what's driving this. I noticed the last two features skipped design review and both needed hotfixes. I think a lightweight design doc before implementation would catch these earlier. What do you think?"

The difference:

| | Command | Feedback with Context |
|---|---|---|
| **Opens with** | What you did wrong | Why I'm bringing this up |
| **Provides** | A directive | A shared picture |
| **Receiver feels** | Defensive | Informed |
| **Ends with** | Compliance or resentment | A conversation |

**Rules of thumb:**
- **Lead with intent** — "I want to help us reduce X" / "I care about Y and I think we can improve"
- **Share the observation** — specific, factual, no interpretation layered in
- **Invite, don't instruct** — "What do you think?" beats "You should do X"

> 💡 If your feedback sentence starts with "You need to..." or "You should...", rewrite it. You're commanding, not collaborating.

## 🔁 Follow Up or It Didn't Happen

Feedback without follow-up signals it wasn't important. If you gave feedback and never checked back, the receiver learns to treat your feedback as noise.

You don't need a formal review. A simple "how's X going?" in the next 1:1 is enough. It shows you meant it, you're invested, and the change matters.

> 💡 No follow-up = implicit message that the feedback was optional.

## 🎯 One Thing at a Time

Stacking 3-4 feedback points in one conversation overwhelms the receiver. They retain none of it, or worse — they fixate on the least important one.

Pick the **highest-impact** item. Deliver it well. Let it land. Save the rest for later.

## 🚪 Ask Before Giving

> "Can I share an observation about X?"

This small move gives the receiver agency. They shift from defensive mode to listening mode. It also forces you to respect their timing — maybe right now is the worst possible moment for them.

If they say "not now," respect it. That tells you something too.

## 🥪 The Feedback Sandwich Is Dead

"Great job on X, but Y needs work, also Z was nice."

Everyone sees through it. It trains people to dread your compliments ("here comes the but...") and dilutes the real message.

Instead: be direct about what you came to say. If there's genuine praise, decouple it — give it at a different time so it stands on its own.

## 🌍 Cultural Awareness

Feedback norms vary massively across cultures. What reads as "direct and helpful" in the Netherlands is "rude" in Japan. What's "polite" in Egypt is "vague" in Germany.

If you're working across cultures:
- **Ask how they prefer feedback** — some prefer private, some prefer written, some want blunt, some need warmth first
- **Don't assume your style is universal** — your default is shaped by your own culture, not by "how feedback works"
- **Watch for silence** — in some cultures, silence after feedback means disagreement, not acceptance

## ✍️ Written vs. Verbal

| | Written | Verbal |
|---|---|---|
| **Strength** | Precise, referenceable, async-friendly | Tone, nuance, real-time dialogue |
| **Weakness** | No tone — easily misread | No record — easily forgotten or disputed |
| **Best for** | Low-stakes, factual, follow-ups | High-stakes, sensitive, relationship-heavy |

**Rule of thumb:** High-stakes feedback → verbal first, then summarize in writing. Low-stakes → async is fine.

## 🛡️ Be Ready for Rejection — Or Silence

You did everything right. You had context, intent, trust, timing. And the receiver rejected it. Or worse — nodded politely and changed nothing.

**This is normal.** Expect it.

Feedback is an offer, not an instruction. The receiver has full authority to disagree, deprioritize, or ignore it. That's their right. If you can't accept that outcome, you weren't giving feedback — you were giving an order disguised as feedback.

**When feedback is rejected:**
- Listen to *why*. Their pushback might contain information you didn't have.
- Don't escalate or repeat louder. That's preaching.
- Check yourself: was this about their growth, or about you being right?

**When feedback is ignored:**
- Follow up once. "I shared X last time — curious if you've thought about it."
- If still ignored, reassess: maybe the feedback wasn't as important as you thought, or maybe you're not the right person to deliver it.
- If the behavior is truly blocking (🔴 level), that's no longer a feedback conversation — it's a performance or accountability conversation. Different tool, different framing.

> 💡 Your job is to deliver the feedback well. The receiver's job is to decide what to do with it. Respect the boundary.
